robots.txt is used primarily to manage crawler traffic to your site, and usually to keep a page off Google, depending on the file type.

It is not hiding web page from Google but it is hiding media and Resource file.
It is managing crawl traffic, and also to prevent image, video, and audio files from appearing in Google search results. (Note that this won't prevent other pages or users from linking to your image/video/audio file.)
You can use robots.txt to block resource files such as unimportant image, script, or style files,

Static sites are the most basic type of website and are the easiest to create. Unlike dynamic websites, they do not require any complex Web programming or database design. A static site can be built by simply creating a few HTML pages and publishing them to a Web server.A dynamic web page, the Content of pages is different for different visitors. It takes more time to load than the static web page.

At a basic level, a dynamic website can give the website owner the ability to simply update and add new content to the site. For example, news and events could be posted to the site through a simple browser interface. Dynamic features of a site are only limited by imagination. Some examples of dynamic website features could be: content management system, e-commerce system, bulletin / discussion boards, intranet or extranet facilities, ability for clients or users to upload documents, ability for administrators or users to create content or add information to a site (dynamic publishing).Easy to develop, Cheap to develop & host
